# Hardwork-Pays-Off-Predicting-Exam-Scores-Model

We are using the Linear Regression to predict the output. We are buliding our Linear Regression from scratch instead of using sklearn module. In this model we first train our model and then we give the test inputs for predicting their outcome. 

In this challenge, we are given a walkatime data of the past students and how they performed in the evaluation exam. Our task is to predict the score. The scores will give the amount of time you spend on coding daily.

### Input:- 
1. We are given the feature file containing the features and the outcome file of that features respectively.(Training Files)
2. We are given one feature corresponding to time noted by walkatime and then we have to predict the outcome for them.(Test File)

### Output:-
1. A scalar denoting the level of performance student achived by devoting the given time.

### Libraries Used :-
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib.pyplot
4. CSV
